# CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Our project values guide us in our daily interactions and decision-making. Hashi, as an open-source project, is committed to fostering a positive and inclusive community. Trust, respect, collaboration, and transparency are core values that should be upheld within our project. We welcome participants from around the world with diverse experiences and perspectives.
Our Pledge
In the interest of creating an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers of the Hashi project, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:
Using welcoming and inclusive language
Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
Collaborating before conflicts arise
Focusing on what is best for the community
Showing empathy towards other community members
Examples of unacceptable behavior by contributors include:
Violence, threats of violence, or incitement to self-harm
Use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
Trolling, intentionally spreading misinformation, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
Public or private harassment
Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
Abuse of the reporting process to intentionally harass or exclude others
Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the Hashi project or its community. Representation includes using official project communication channels, posting via official social media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting us anonymously through this form [https://forms.gle/xwoqmnf4MAqq8mq1A]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
If you are unsure whether an incident is a violation or whether the space where the incident took place is covered by our Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We would prefer to have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action than to leave an incident go unnoticed and unresolved. Reports deemed not a violation will also help us improve our Code of Conduct and processes surrounding it.
Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4.with gratitude for their commitment to fostering positive and inclusive open-source communities.
